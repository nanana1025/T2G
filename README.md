# T2G
We propose Time2Graph, a novel graph-based model for time series classification(TSC). Time2Graph maximizes both embedding fidelity and classification performance by constructing a nested graph composed of a macro graph, which captures the global relationships among time series, and micro graphs, each of which reflects the local characteristics within each individual time series.

## Installation
Please use both Python 3.6. and Python 3.8
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Datasets
We provide an example dataset **Coffee** in this repository. You may download the full UCR datasets [here](https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/time_series_data_2018/).

## Quick Start
We use **Coffee** as an example to demonstrate how to run the code. You may easily try other datasets with arguments `--dataset`. We will show how to get the results for SimTSC and T2G.

First, prepare the dataset with (the generated dataset is already available in this repository)
```
python3.6 create_dataset.py
```

Second, install the python wrapper of UCR DTW library with
```
git clone https://github.com/daochenzha/pydtw.git
cd pydtw
pip3 install -e .
cd ..
```

Third, compute the dtw matrix for **Coffee** (the dtw matrix is already available in this repository)
```
python3.6 create_dtw.py
```

Fourth, compute the dtw matrix for subsequences of **Coffee** (the subsequence dtw matrix is already available in this repository)
```
python3.6 get_subsequence_dtw.py
```

1. For SimTSC:
```
python3.8 train_simtsc.py
```

2. For T2G:
```
python3.8 train_simtsc.py

All the logs will be saved in `logs/`
